# Stage 2: Project setup and base UI

## Goal
Create the Next.js app, configure TypeScript + Tailwind, and scaffold the base pages.

## Outcome
A running local dev server with a basic layout and placeholder pages for the teacher dashboard and student quiz flow.

## Prompts to give an AI agent
1. "Set up a Next.js 16 app with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Use the App Router. Add a global layout and basic styling."
2. "Create placeholder routes and pages for: /teacher, /login, /signup, /quiz/[token], and /results/[id]. Provide simple UI headers and placeholders."
3. "Create a reusable UI components folder (e.g., src/components/ui) and add a few basic components: Button, Card, Input."
4. "Add a README section that lists the development commands (npm run dev/build/start/lint) and required environment variables."

## Notes
- Keep the UI clean and readable.
- The focus is on getting the project running locally.
