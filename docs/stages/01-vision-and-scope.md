# Stage 1: Vision, scope, and user flows

## Goal
Define what Levelly is, who uses it, and the minimum features to ship.

## Outcome
A clear product brief, user flows, and a checklist of features.

## Prompts to give an AI agent
1. "You are a product-and-UX assistant. Summarize the app: an AI-powered quiz platform where teachers create quizzes and students take them via share links. Produce a 1-page product brief and list core features for teachers and students. Keep it simple for a non-technical founder."
2. "Create user flow diagrams in text for: (a) teacher creates quiz → publishes → shares link, (b) student opens link → answers → gets level and redirect. Keep it short and clear."
3. "Define the MVP feature list and what can be skipped for version 1. Include roles (teacher, student) and grading flow (MCQ instant, open-ended AI)."
4. "Based on the Levelly concept, write acceptance criteria for each core feature so we can verify it works."

## Notes
- Keep the language non-technical.
- The app must support MCQ + open-ended questions, AI grading, and level-based redirects.
