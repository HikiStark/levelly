# Stage 7: Polish, testing, and deployment

## Goal
Make the app reliable and deploy it.

## Outcome
A production-ready build running on Vercel with stable UX.

## Prompts to give an AI agent
1. "Add basic validation and error states to forms (quiz builder, student quiz, login/signup)."
2. "Add minimal analytics or logging for quiz submissions and grading status."
3. "Write a short user guide in /docs describing teacher and student workflows."
4. "Create a Vercel deployment checklist: environment variables, build commands, and post-deploy checks."

## Notes
- Keep performance and clarity in mind.
- Add small UX improvements (loading states, success confirmations).
